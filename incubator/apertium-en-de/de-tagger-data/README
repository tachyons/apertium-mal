In order to train the German part-of-speech tagger you need to put some
corpora here:

* For supervised training: 
  - A file called 'de.tagged' should contain the hand-tagged corpus.
  - A file called 'de.tagged.txt' should contain the same corpus that
    'de.tagged' contains, but in RAW format.

* For unsupervised training:
  - A file called 'de.crp.txt' should contain large corpus in RAW format
